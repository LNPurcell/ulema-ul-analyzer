# U.L.E.M.A. Upper Limb Evaluation in Motion Analysis

U.L.E.M.A. is a MATLAB-based GUI tool for quickly processing motion capture data (C3D files) recorded by using Motion Capture devices.

It is bundled with Report Generator, a stand-alone Python-based and plugin-enabled GUI application for transforming custom-made templates into (editable) reports.

The software was developed by the Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium) as result of collaboration among the following groups:
- [CMAL-P](http://www.uzleuven.be/en/laboratory-for-clinical-movementanalysis/research) (Laboratory for Clinical Movement Analysis, UZ Pellenberg) 
- [PMA](http://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/) (Division of Production engineering, Machine design and Automation)
- [FaBeR](http://www.kuleuven.be/english) (Faculty of Kinesiology and Rehabilitation Sciences)

The most recent version of U.L.E.M.A. is **1.0.6**.

The most recent version of Report Generator is **1.1**.

**Requirements** for U.L.E.M.A.:
+ Windows XP / 7 (Linux / MacOSX are not yet supported)
+ [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.nl/products/matlab/) (with [Signal Processing Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.nl/products/signal/) included)

**Requirements** for Report Generator:
+ Windows XP / Vista / 7

**Documentation:**

Both U.L.E.M.A and Report Generator are corredated with documentation files. These can be found inside the folder *Doc* of each application.

**What's new**

U.L.E.M.A.:

1.0.6 (14/06/2013):
- Raw data reading, previously part of the kinematics process, now is in a separate section. 
- Documentation updated  

1.0.5 (03/05/2013):
- When exporting to C3D, the region of non-forced-to-0 angles is expanded of 1 frame, to avoid
  bad visualization in Polygon
- MAPs bar graphs have colors for a better indentifaction of overlapped IQR
- MAPs title is split in 2 rows, to avoid clipping when too long. 

1.0.4 (22/05/2013):
- For the angle curves, data is forced to 0 before the first event and after the last event,
  for every file, before exporting to C3D. This way, angle data between first and last event
  is good since we agreed to have good markers data in that interval. Without bad marker data,
  Polygon will never parse for bad data into the C3Ds and will always plot curves data.

1.0.3 (30/04/2013):
- Added automatic gimbal-lock correction for joint angles
- timeVmax is in % of the phase duration and not in seconds anymore
- protocols Left, Right, Right_Pellenberg, Left_Pellenberg, Right_NoGH_Pellenberg, Left_NoGH_Pellenberg
  edited to follow planned protocol at UZ Pellenberg 

1.0.2 (04/03/2013):
- Corrected measurement unit for trajectory index when exporting to C3D
- Technical marker data is not written back anymore to C3D (for safety reasons)
- "Proc. data saving" is added under Options -> Processing
- Documentation updated with section 6.6
- In ProtDB.mat added 2 new protocols used in Pellenberg Kliniek (Leuven, Belgium)

1.0.1 (11/10/2012):
- First draft of documentation created
- Minor user-interface labels changed
- For a selected segmentation method, a small description is shown

1.0 (05/10/2012):
- Official name for the software is decided:
  U.L.E.M.A.: Upper Limb Evaluation in Motion Analysis

1.0 (24/09/2012):
- First release


Report generator:

1.1 (05/10/2012): 
- Added "Descriptors Editor" tool under main window -> "Tools" -> "Descriptors Editor..."
- The software is now plugin based (where UL is the only puglin available now); this makes the
  software ideally customizable for every other purpose

1.0 (24/09/2012):
- First release
